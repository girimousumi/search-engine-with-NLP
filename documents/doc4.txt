Title: Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum mechanics to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers, which use bits, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, that can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers.
